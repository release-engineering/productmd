======================
Images file format 1.0
======================

images.json files provide details about images included in composes.


File Format
===========

Compose images metadata is stored as a JSON serialized dictionary.
It's recommended to sort keys alphabetically and use 4 spaces for indentation
in order to read and diff images.json files easily.
